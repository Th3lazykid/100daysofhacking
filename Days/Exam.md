Since covid is somewhat dead, Uni people decided to help us with offline exams. (Big Smile)

- This is 5th sem ending, and I do not know anything except the subjects.
- Also it's gonna be last exams of bachelor's degree. As 6th sem is internship-sem.
- So just taking a break to reflect on uni studies and will be back after it is done.
- Wait, Since also selected for Infra Security Null Study Group - Will update whatsoever is been discussed if got permissions.
