  - [EP 71: FDFF](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/71/): North Korea? Am I feeling lucky not to born there? A BIG YES. North Korean regime has been there for more than seventy years, where they brainwash people so bad that nothing matters to them more than what the leader of the North Korea says. They don't have internet but intranet. I won't rant about North korea much here, but this story is about sending outside information to the people of the NK using flash drives, an amazing initiative by [Alex Gladstein](https://twitter.com/gladstein), And about the guest, [Yeonmi Park](https://twitter.com/YeonmiParkNK) who escaped North Korea and went to china and now in US. Listen to the podcast to know more scarry things about North korea, Watched a foreign movie, you might have been executed for watching the same, if you were in north korea, now imagine how lucky you are. :)
