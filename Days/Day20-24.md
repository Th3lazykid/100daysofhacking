# Day-20 to Day-24 Summary:

### Things Done:

- [X] Gave talk on Cyber-Security: Gave a good overview of what "hacking" is, it's myths, my journey [Lameline xD] and explaning multiple cyber-security fields. Making sure not to skip the mental health as well as how to grow within this vast field. Sadly, the talk isn't recorded but slides are below, which was explained thoroughly at that moment.

- [X] Organized HacktoberFest at college: This was First Offline event organized since corona fucked up the world. Loved the enthusiasm of students, volunteers and personally learned more than I thought of. And lemme write this, Managing more than 100 people is way too difficult as it seems to be. But anyways, it was 2 day event at college filled with talks regarding open-source tech, Git & GitHub, Music jam and much more, with more than 100 students joining.
