"Life is a difficult game. You can win it only by retaining your birthright to be a person." - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam

# Day-17, 18 & 19 Summary:

### Things Done: 
  - Been sick for past 2-3 days, but still:

- [X] **SSRF Lab #4:** [Web-Security Academy - SSRF with whitelist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter) -- PortSwigger; [Rana Khalil's Course](https://ranakhalil.teachable.com/);
  
  -  Goal: Change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user carlos. 
  -  Condition:  The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass. 
  -  Solution: This was by far the hardest lab, it took me a good amount of time to understand, Not sure if I'm in that position to explain you in good way, but let's do it. 
     - Starting with accessing http://localhost/ - comes with an error saying that you have to include `stock.weliketoshop.net` in the url, basically a whitelist.
     - Now we gotta be using that domain and smart enough to bypass the defence mechanism in order to get access to localhost.
     - Trying with `username@stock.weliketoshop.net` - I didn't know about this before until I researched about this, basic stuff. So this is part of url whole structure for example: `http://user:pass@example.com:8080`. So here trying with  `username@` to check if url accepts embedded credentials. 
     - Using the above, concluded it was possible. But still an error with `"Could not connect to external stock check service"`. 
     - Now, Adding the `#` to the payload `username#@stock.weliketoshop.net` gives error again, reason is that it is watching `username#` as the url instead of `stock.weliketoshop.net`
     - Now let's encode the `#` once and check. Error, brrrr. Twice. Internal server error. Indicating that the server may have attempted to connect to "username".
     - Changing the payload; localhost instead of username: `http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/`. We got it.
     - Adding /admin to path gives us the admin page, payload: `http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin`
     - Adding /delete?username=carlos to the path [which got from the response code], deletes the username carlos, payload: `http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos`
     - Voila.
  - Automation: Find the python code [HERE](/Python/SSRF-lab4.py). Not explaining because it is the same script as lab-1, just payload diff. So check out the explanation [here](/Days/Day14.md).

- [X] **SSRF Lab #5:** [Web-Security Academy - SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-filter-bypass-via-open-redirection) -- PortSwigger; [Rana Khalil's Course](https://ranakhalil.teachable.com/);
  - Goal: Change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin` and delete the user carlos. 
  - Condition: The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first. 
  - Solution: This lab can be solved by chaining the open-redirection vuln with ssrf. First requesting the check-stock request, as well as next-product request.
    - In the next-product request, adding `https://th3lazykid.gitbook.io` to the path, redirects to the requested site, confirms that there is open-redirect vuln.
    - `/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=3&path=https://th3lazykid.gitbook.io`
    - Now coming back to the check-stock request where the actuall ssrf vuln exist. Taking the payload from next-product request, replacing the path with `http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`, hence the final payload: `/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/`, decoding it, adding to the param stockApi and sending to it gives the admin access.
    - Next using the delete username path, gives us this payload which helps to delete the username carlos: `/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`
    - Yea, that's it. 
  - Automation: Find the python code [HERE](/Python/SSRF-lab5.py). Not explaining because it is the same script as lab-1, just payload diff. So check out the explanation [here](/Days/Day14.md).

- [X] **SSRF Lab #6:** [Web-Security Academy - Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-out-of-band-detection) -- PortSwigger; [Rana Khalil's Course](https://ranakhalil.teachable.com/);
  - Understood the lab, but cannot solve it practically since it needs Burp Collaborator client, which only comes only with pro version of Burp.
  - Basically, in this lab, we here are taking advantage of referrer header as `this site uses analytics software which fetches the URL specified in the Referer header when a product page is loaded.` and changing it to burp collaborator client domain, since it is a blind ssrf.

- [X] **SSRF Lab #7:** [Web-Security Academy - Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-shellshock-exploitation) -- PortSwigger; [Rana Khalil's Course](https://ranakhalil.teachable.com/);
  - Again same, this lab needs Burp Collaborator client, which only comes only with pro version of Burp.
  - Also this lab is tough as well, marked as exert. Somewhat understood it, cannot explain cause even I haven't done it hands-on. Maybe in the future. 

### **Tryhackme SSRF Room:**
  - [X] Good room, A good basic recap of what done in the labs as well about the concept. The room consisted of regular type of SSRF, not blind but just a overview of:
    - SSRF Examples
    - Finding SSRF
    - Defeating Common SSRF Defenses
      - Allow list - Whitelist
      - Deny list - Blacklist
    - Concluded with sweet challenge.
