# Day-15 Summary:

### Things Done Today:

- Was supposed to complete the Pivoting sub-topic in Wreath Network, but understanding python code for SSRF lab #2 consumed most of my day, so instead of that, I listend to Darknet Diaries Ep 102. 

- [X] **SSRF Lab #2:** [Web-Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system) -- PortSwigger; [Rana Khalil's Course](https://ranakhalil.teachable.com/);
  - Done with lab#2 today: It was pretty easy and understanding to the python code was a bit difficult, I mean it took time [Check out the full code in good format here], which I'm gonna tryna explain you people here below.

- [X] **Darknet Diaries:**

  - [EP 102: Money Maker](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/102/): Such a amazing story of Frank Bourassa, how he started re-selling stolen clothes to making $250 million fake money - $20 US bills. Counterfeiting money is really complex process, getting paper, ink, printers, etc. Loved how he made up the story and got the papers needed to make the fake money, which is to be considered the hardest part in the whole process. Listen to the podcast to know how he got caught and how his lawyer used "Big Brains", that saved him from getting 60 years around of prision but instead just $1500 fine.
